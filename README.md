Web Design HW - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

Background: In this assignment, we must use data and output (scatterplots) to design a dashboard-type website based on Weather data (tables and scatterplots) from a prior assignment.

Purpose: The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate a visually appealing and very navigation-friendly website.  The website should be descriptive regarding what is being observed and easy to navigate.  For example, there should be a dropdown navigation to review each of the (4) different scatterplots.  The user should also be able to click on the title and return back to the original (index) page.

Tools: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.  Also, Pandas was used to create html output.  Matplotlib was originally used to create the scatterplots.
